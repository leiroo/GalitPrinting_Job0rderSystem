# AI-Driven Job Order System with Analytics and Recommendation Features  
**for Galit Digital Printing Services**

---

## 📌 Project Description
Galit Digital Printing Services in Lobo, Batangas processes around 2,000 orders monthly, offering services such as tarpaulin printing, custom apparel, signage, event giveaways, billboards, and sintraboard.

Currently, the shop relies on handwritten logs and outdated spreadsheets, leading to inefficiencies, delays, and customer dissatisfaction.

This project introduces an **AI-driven, web-based Job Order Management System prototype** designed for **admin-only access**. It includes:
- **Simulated job order tracking**  
- **Inventory and records overview**  
- **Dashboard analytics with AI-powered recommendation placeholders**  
- **Dark mode feature** for a modern and user-friendly interface  

As a **UI prototype**, the system does not include backend or database integration — it uses **static JSON data for demonstration purposes.**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The prototype addresses these issues by providing:

- A **centralized admin dashboard** for job orders, records, and inventory management.  
- **Real-time (simulated)** job status and inventory tracking.  
- **Analytics and AI placeholders** for future decision-making.  
- **Dark mode interface** to reduce eye strain and improve usability.

- Add an **inventory monitoring module** with stock alerts (simulation).  
- Implement **dark mode UI.**  
- Ensure **responsive design** for various screen sizes.  
- Prepare a **foundation for AI-powered recommendations** in future phases.
